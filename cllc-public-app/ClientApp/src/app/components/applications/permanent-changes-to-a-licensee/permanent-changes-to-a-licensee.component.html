        <div class="content-bottom">
            <p>
                Sole proprietors and associates of applicants for a non-medical cannabis licence are required to submit
                documentation for
                security screenings and/or financial integrity checks. Cannabis retail store licence applications cannot
                be processed until
                all required materials have been received.
            </p>

            <p>
                Please note, the security screening for sole proprietors and associates differs from the security
                verification for people
                seeking work in non-medical cannabis retail stores. The screening for associates considers the associate
                within the context
                of a larger organizational structure. The security verification for workers considers the worker as an
                individual apart
                from an organization. If a sole proprietor or associate seeks to work in a non-medical cannabis retail
                store, they must pass both.
            </p>

            <p>
                Cannabis Associate Security Screening documents are not required if you submit liquor related
                applications. If you do not provide
                Cannabis Associate Security Screening documents prior to your application submission, they will be
                requested via secure channels
                once your application has been received. Please note that the time to collect these documents directly
                impacts the time to process your application.
            </p>

            This form should be signed by an individual with the authority to bind the applicant. The Branch relies on

            individual will be as follows:

        <ul>
            <li> If the licensee is an individual or sole proprietor, the individual himself/herself</li>
            <li>If the licensee is a corporation, a duly authorized signatory who will usually be an officer or, in some

            <li>If the licensee is a limited partnership, the general partner of the partnership</li>
            <li>If the licensee is a society, then a director or a senior manager (as defined in the Societies Act)</li>

            Section 57(1)(c) of the Liquor Control and Licensing Act states: “A person commits an offence if the person
