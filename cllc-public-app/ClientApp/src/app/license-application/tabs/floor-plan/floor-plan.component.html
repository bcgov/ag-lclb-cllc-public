<h1>Floor Plan</h1>
<p>Your floor plan must reflect what your store will look like at the time of your licence being issued. If you plan on making renovations, submit the floor plan you are developing.</p>
<p>After you receive conditional approval, the province will inspect your store to make sure it matches the information you submitted in your plans.</p>

<h2>Floor Plan</h2>
<p>Upload a floor plan of your store layout. The plans must be clear and legible, in PDF format that is still legible when zoomed in.</p>
