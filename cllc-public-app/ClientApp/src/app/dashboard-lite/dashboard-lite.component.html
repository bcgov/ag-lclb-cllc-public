        A non-medical cannabis retail store licence allows licensees to sell non-medical cannabis and cannabis
        accessories in British
        Columbia.
      </p>

      <p>
        To apply for a non-medical cannabis retail store licence, applicants must submit a completed
        application form and completed business financial integrity form. A separate application and business financial
        integrity form is required for each proposed establishment.
      </p>

      <p>The Liquor and Cannabis Regulation Branch (LCRB) will only process complete applications. The checklist
        accompanying
        the application form can assist in completing all required documentation.</p>
      <p>Please note that applications which are submitted without all required information or documents will not be
        processed.
        Applicants will be contacted and provided the opportunity to submit missing information. Once applicants
        provide
        all required documents to the LCRB, the application will be submitted for processing.</p>
      <p>Inquires related to your application can be directed to <a href="mailto:cannabis.licensing@gov.bc.ca">cannabis.licensing@gov.bc.ca</a>.</p>
