    I want to pay the first year licensing fee for an approved CRS Application
    And renew the licence

    And I review the account profile for a private corporation
    And I review the organization structure for a private corporation
    And I click on the button for Submit Organization Information
    And I complete the Cannabis Retail Store application for a private corporation
    And I click on the button for Pay for Application
    And I enter the payment information
    And the application is approved
    And I pay the licensing fee for Cannabis
    And the expiry date is changed to today
    And I renew the licence
    And the account is deleted
